        <ul>
            <li>Basketball is also a sport of accuracy, but it also requires mobility skills and teamwork.</li>
            <li>I haven't played basketball in a long time, yet I still like it because this sport is enjoyable, especially with friends.</li>
            <li>My favorite player is Lebron James because even if he is old, he is still really good at basketball and I like seeing him dunk.</li>
