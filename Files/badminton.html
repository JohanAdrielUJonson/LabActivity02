            <li>Badminton is a sport that could be fun but needs a lesser amount of stamina to play than other sports.</li>
            <li>Badminton is distinguished by accuracy and skill that is acquired overtime.</li>
            <li>Even though I like this sport, I don't really know any famous person playing this sport because I am not that interested and I just want to play the sport.</li>
